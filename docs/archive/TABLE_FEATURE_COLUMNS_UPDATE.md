# Table Feature Columns Update ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

Added bedrooms, bathrooms, and extra features columns to the property search results table to provide more detailed property information at a glance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated View (`taxprotest/views.py`)

**Modified `index()` view:**
- Added query for building details (bedrooms, bathrooms) from `BuildingDetail` model
- Added query for extra features (pool, garage, etc.) from `ExtraFeature` model
- Filters only active records (`is_active=True`)
- Uses `format_feature_list()` to create readable feature summaries
- Passes new data to template in results dictionary

**Modified `export_csv()` view:**
- Added "Bedrooms", "Bathrooms", and "Features" columns to CSV export
- Replaced "Land Area" with bedroom/bathroom/features data
- Maintains same query logic as the main view

### 2. Updated Template (`templates/index.html`)

**Table Structure Changes:**
- **Removed:** "Land Area" column (to save space)
- **Added:** "Bed/Bath" column - displays bedrooms/bathrooms as "3/2" format
- **Added:** "Features" column - shows truncated list of extra features with tooltip

**Column Order:**
1. Account #
2. Owner
3. Street #
4. Street Name
5. Zip
6. Assessed Value
7. Building Area
8. **Bed/Bath** (NEW)
9. **Features** (NEW)
10. $/SF
11. Actions (sticky)

### 3. Display Format

**Bedrooms/Bathrooms:**
```
3 / 2.0     (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms)
2 / 1.5     (2 bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms)
-           (no data available)
```

**Features Column:**
- Shows up to 5 features (in table) or 10 features (in CSV)
- Truncates long feature lists with "..." and shows full list on hover
- Examples: "Pool, Spa, Detached Garage"
- Uses `format_feature_list()` from `data/similarity.py` for consistent formatting

## Data Source

**BuildingDetail Model:**
- `bedrooms` - Integer field
- `bathrooms` - Decimal field (supports half baths like 2.5)
- Filtered by `is_active=True` to show only current data

**ExtraFeature Model:**
- Multiple records per property (pool, garage, patio, etc.)
- `feature_code` and `feature_description` fields
- Filtered by `is_active=True` to show only current features

## Benefits

1. **More Information:** Users can see bedroom/bathroom counts without clicking through
2. **Feature Visibility:** Pool, garage, and other amenities are immediately visible
3. **Better Filtering:** Users can mentally filter results based on features
4. **Space Efficient:** Replaced less-critical "Land Area" column with more useful data
5. **CSV Export:** All new data is included in exported CSV files

## UI Details

### Styling
- **Bed/Bath column:** Right-aligned, compact format with "/" separator
- **Features column:** Left-aligned, truncated with tooltip on hover
- **Empty states:** Shows "-" when data is not available
- **Text truncation:** Features truncate at 200px width with ellipsis

### Responsive Design
- All columns maintain responsive text sizing (`text-xs lg:text-sm`)
- Horizontal scroll enabled for narrow screens
- Actions column remains sticky on right side

## Performance Considerations

**Database Queries:**
- Uses `filter(is_active=True)` to query only current records
- Uses `.first()` for building details (one per property)
- Uses `list()` for features (multiple per property)
- Queries are executed per property in the pagination set (200 properties max per page)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Could use `prefetch_related()` to reduce query count
- Could use `select_related()` for building details
- Consider adding these if performance becomes an issue:
  ```python
  qs = qs.prefetch_related('buildings', 'extra_features')
  ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Properties with building data show bed/bath correctly
- [ ] Properties without building data show "-"
- [ ] Properties with features show truncated list
- [ ] Hover over features shows full list in tooltip
- [ ] CSV export includes new columns
- [ ] Empty feature column shows "-"
- [ ] Table remains responsive on mobile
- [ ] Sticky Actions column still works
- [ ] Pagination maintains data

## Example Output

### Table Display:
```
Acct #          | Owner      | Street # | Street Name | Zip   | Value    | Area  | Bed/Bath | Features                 | $/SF   | Actions
----------------|------------|----------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|----------|--------------------------|--------|--------
123456789012345 | Smith, John| 123      | Main St     | 77001 | $250,000 | 1,800 | 3 / 2.0  | Pool, Spa, Detached Ga...| $138.89| Similar
```

### CSV Export:
```csv
Account Number,Owner Name,Street Number,Street Name,Zip Code,Assessed Value,Building Area (sqft),Bedrooms,Bathrooms,Features,Price per sqft
123456789012345,Smith John,123,Main St,77001,250000,1800,3,2.0,"Pool, Spa, Detached Garage (2)",138.89
```

## Related Files

**Modified:**
- `taxprotest/views.py` - Added building/feature queries
- `templates/index.html` - Updated table structure

**Used:**
- `data/models.py` - BuildingDetail, ExtraFeature models
- `data/similarity.py` - `format_feature_list()` function

## Notes

- The linting errors in the IDE are expected (Django is installed in Docker, not locally)
- Features are formatted using the same function as the similarity search for consistency
- Building and feature data must be imported via `import_building_data` command
- If no building/feature data exists, columns show "-" gracefully

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sortable Columns:** Click headers to sort by bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
2. **Feature Filters:** Add search filters for specific features (has pool, has garage)
3. **Year Built:** Could add another column for property age
4. **Inline Editing:** Allow updating feature data from the table
5. **Feature Icons:** Show icons for common features (üèä for pool, üöó for garage)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Use
