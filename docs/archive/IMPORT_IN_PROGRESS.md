# Import Status - Building Data Import Running ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 16, 2025 (UTC)  
**Status**: **IMPORTING IN PROGRESS** üîÑ  
**Task ID**: `30804de2-df9a-486f-8a68-9342fa05334a`

---

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Previous Error**: `field larger than field limit (131072)`

**Root Cause**: Python's CSV module has a default field size limit of ~128KB which was being exceeded by some HCAD data fields.

**Solution**: Added `csv.field_size_limit(10485760)` to `data/etl.py` to increase the limit to 10MB.

**Result**: Import now processing successfully!

## What's Being Imported

### Building Details (building_res.txt)
- Living area (heat_area)
- Year built, year remodeled
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, half baths
- Building type, style, class
- Quality and condition codes
- Number of stories
- Foundation type
- Exterior wall material
- Roof type and cover
- Number of fireplaces

### Extra Features (extra_features.txt - after buildings)
- Swimming pools
- Garages and carports
- Patios and decks
- Sheds and storage
- Other improvements

---

## Monitor the Import

### Watch Real-time Progress
```bash
docker compose logs -f worker
```

### Check Latest Status
```bash
docker compose logs worker --tail=10
```

### Check Task Status
```bash
docker compose exec web python -c "
from celery.result import AsyncResult
import django, os
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'taxprotest.settings')
django.setup()

task = AsyncResult('30804de2-df9a-486f-8a68-9342fa05334a')
print(f'State: {task.state}')
if task.result:
    print(f'Result: {task.result}')
"
```

### Check Database Counts
```bash
docker compose exec web python -c "
import django, os
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'taxprotest.settings')
django.setup()

from data.models import BuildingDetail, ExtraFeature
print(f'Buildings: {BuildingDetail.objects.count():,}')
print(f'Features: {ExtraFeature.objects.count():,}')
"
```

---

## Website Status

**URL**: http://localhost:8000/  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ONLINE AND RESPONSIVE**

The website remains fully functional during the import:
- Search for properties by owner name or address
- View property details
- Export search results to CSV
- Pagination works

**Note**: The "Find Similar" feature will work better once the building/feature import completes, as it uses:
- Living area for size comparison
- Year built for age comparison
- Bedrooms/bathrooms for room matching
- Extra features (pools, garages) for amenity matching

---

## What Happens Next

### Phase 1: Building Import (Current)
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Records: 0 ‚Üí ~2-3 million
- Time: ~30-40 minutes

### Phase 2: Feature Import (After Buildings)
- Status: NOT STARTED
- Records: 0 ‚Üí ~3-5 million  
- Time: ~30-40 minutes

### Phase 3: Completion
- Task status changes to SUCCESS
- Final counts reported
- Similarity search fully functional

---

## Testing After Import Completes

### 1. Verify Data Import
```bash
docker compose exec web python -c "
import django, os
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'taxprotest.settings')
django.setup()

from data.models import PropertyRecord, BuildingDetail, ExtraFeature

props_with_buildings = PropertyRecord.objects.filter(buildings__isnull=False).distinct().count()
props_with_features = PropertyRecord.objects.filter(extra_features__isnull=False).distinct().count()

print(f'Total Properties: {PropertyRecord.objects.count():,}')
print(f'Properties with Buildings: {props_with_buildings:,}')
print(f'Properties with Features: {props_with_features:,}')
print(f'Total Buildings: {BuildingDetail.objects.count():,}')
print(f'Total Features: {ExtraFeature.objects.count():,}')
"
```

### 2. Test Similarity Search
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/
2. Search for a property (e.g., last name "Smith")
3. Click "Find Similar" button on any property
4. Verify results show:
   - Nearby properties sorted by similarity score
   - Distance in miles
   - Building specs (area, year, beds/baths)
   - Extra features listed

### 3. Verify Building Data Integration
```bash
docker compose exec web python -c "
import django, os
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'taxprotest.settings')
django.setup()

from data.models import PropertyRecord

# Find a property with building data
prop = PropertyRecord.objects.filter(buildings__isnull=False).first()
if prop:
    print(f'Property: {prop.street_number} {prop.street_name}')
    print(f'Account: {prop.account_number}')
    building = prop.buildings.first()
    if building:
        print(f'Living Area: {building.heat_area} sqft')
        print(f'Year Built: {building.year_built}')
        print(f'Bedrooms: {building.bedrooms}')
        print(f'Bathrooms: {building.bathrooms}')
    features = prop.extra_features.all()
    if features:
        print(f'Features:')
        for f in features[:5]:
            print(f'  - {f.feature_description}')
"
```

## System Resources

### Database Size
- Current: ~1.6M properties
- After import: ~1.6M properties + ~2-3M buildings + ~3-5M features
- Estimated total: ~7-10 million records

### Disk Space
- downloads/ directory: ~2GB (ZIP + extracted files)
- Database: Will grow to ~3-5GB
- Ensure adequate space available

### Memory Usage
- Worker process: ~500MB-1GB during import
- Database: ~500MB-1GB
- Total system: ~2-3GB recommended

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Import Seems Stuck
Check worker logs:
```bash
docker compose logs worker --tail=50
```

Look for continued progress messages like:
```
Loaded 25000 building records...
Loaded 30000 building records...
```

### If Worker Dies
Check for out-of-memory errors:
```bash
docker compose logs worker | grep -i "killed\|oom\|memory"
```

If OOM, increase Docker memory limit in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
worker:
  mem_limit: 4g
```

### If Import Fails Again
Check the specific error:
```bash
docker compose logs worker | grep -i "error\|exception\|failed"
```

## Files Modified

**data/etl.py**: Added `csv.field_size_limit(10485760)` at the top to handle large CSV fields

This fix allows the CSV parser to handle HCAD data fields that exceed the default 128KB limit.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for import to complete** (~45-70 minutes total)
2. **Verify data** using the commands above
3. **Test similarity search** on the website
4. **Monitor monthly schedule** (2nd Tuesday at 2 AM) for automatic updates

## Summary

‚úÖ **CSV field size limit fixed**  
üîÑ **Import running successfully** (20,000+ records so far)  
‚úÖ **Website online and functional**  
‚è≥ **Estimated completion**: 45-70 minutes  
üìä **Expected result**: ~5-8 million building/feature records  

The import is processing smoothly and will complete automatically. No further action needed - just wait for the task to finish!
