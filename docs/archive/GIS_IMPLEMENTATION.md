# GIS and Features Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `latitude`, `longitude`, and `parcel_id` fields to `PropertyRecord` model
- All three fields are indexed for efficient spatial queries
- Migration created and applied successfully

### 2. GIS Data Pipeline
- Added `geopandas` and `pyogrio` to requirements.txt for shapefile processing
- Created `load_gis_parcels()` function in `data/etl.py` to:
  - Read shapefiles with any coordinate system
  - Convert to WGS84 (standard lat/long)
  - Calculate parcel centroids
  - Match parcels to properties by account number
  - Batch update coordinates efficiently

### 3. Management Command
- Created `load_gis_data` management command
- Automatically downloads Parcels.zip from HCAD
- Extracts and processes shapefile
- Updates existing PropertyRecord entries with coordinates

### 4. Documentation
- Created `GIS_SETUP.md` with full instructions
- Includes troubleshooting and verification steps

## ðŸš€ Usage

To import GIS data:
```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py load_gis_data
```

To verify:
```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py shell
>>> from data.models import PropertyRecord
>>> PropertyRecord.objects.filter(latitude__isnull=False).count()
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for "Find Similar Properties" Feature

### Phase 1: Import Property Features (To Do)
We need to extend the data model to include:

1. **Building Details Table** (new model):
   - Year built
   - Building quality
   - Building condition
   - Number of stories
   - Building style/type
   - Foundation type
   - Exterior wall type
   - Roof cover type

2. **Extra Features Table** (new model):
   - Pool (yes/no + type)
   - Pool heater (yes/no)
   - Spa (yes/no)
   - Detached garage (yes/no + count)
   - Carport (yes/no + count)
   - Other amenities

These can be imported from HCAD files:
- `Real_building_land.txt` - Building details
- `Real_acct_extr_feat.txt` - Extra features

### Phase 2: Implement "Find Similar" Search
Once we have coordinates and features:

1. **Similarity Algorithm**:
   - Distance filter: Properties within X miles (using lat/long)
   - Size filter: Building area within Â±20%
   - Land filter: Land area within Â±30%
   - Feature matching: Properties with similar amenities

2. **SQL Query with PostGIS** (optional but faster):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM data_propertyrecord
   WHERE ST_DWithin(
       ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)::geography,
       ST_MakePoint(?, ?)::geography,
       5000  -- 5km radius
   )
   AND building_area BETWEEN ? AND ?
   ```

3. **UI Changes**:
   - Add "Find Similar" button to each row
   - Create similarity view showing matched properties
   - Highlight matching features
   - Show distance from original property

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Map view showing similar properties
- Comparison table (side-by-side)
- Export similar properties to CSV
- Save searches for later

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- Coordinate system: WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for universal compatibility
- Spatial queries will use Django ORM + raw SQL for distance calculations
- Consider adding PostGIS extension to PostgreSQL for advanced spatial operations
- Current implementation uses Python-based distance calculations (haversine formula)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations

- GIS import: ~10-30 minutes for 1M+ parcels
- Batch size: 5000 records per transaction
- Indexes on account_number, latitude, longitude ensure fast lookups
- Similar property search should complete in <1 second with proper indexing
