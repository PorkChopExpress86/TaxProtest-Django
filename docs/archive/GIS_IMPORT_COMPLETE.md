# GIS Import - Scheduled Task Setup Complete ✅

**Date Completed:** October 16, 2025

## Summary
Created a separate annual scheduled task for GIS location data imports. This task runs once per year since property locations rarely change, and can also be triggered manually via the Django admin panel.

## What Was Added

### 1. New Celery Task: `download_and_import_gis_data`
**File:** `data/tasks.py`

- Downloads `Parcels.zip` from HCAD
- Extracts shapefile data
- Updates all PropertyRecord instances with latitude/longitude
- Processes ~1.5 million records
- Takes 30-45 minutes to complete

### 2. Celery Beat Schedule Configuration
**File:** `taxprotest/celery.py`

**Schedule:** January 15th at 3:00 AM Central Time (annually)

```python
'download-and-import-gis-data-annually': {
    'task': 'data.tasks.download_and_import_gis_data',
    'schedule': crontab(
        month_of_year='1',
        day_of_month='15',
        hour=3,
        minute=0,
    ),
}
```

### 3. Django Admin Actions
**File:** `data/admin.py`

Added two admin actions to the DownloadRecord admin:
- ✅ **"Trigger GIS location data import (manual)"** - Run GIS import on demand
- ✅ **"Trigger building data import (manual)"** - Run building data import on demand

### 4. Documentation
**File:** `GIS_IMPORT_SCHEDULE.md`

Complete documentation covering:
- Why annual updates
- Scheduled import details
- Manual trigger methods
- Monitoring and troubleshooting
- Database impact
- Testing procedures

## How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)
The task runs automatically every January 15th at 3 AM. No action needed.

### Manual Trigger - Django Admin (Easy)
1. Go to admin: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. Navigate to "Data" → "Download records"
3. Select any record(s)
4. Choose "Trigger GIS location data import (manual)" from Actions dropdown
5. Click "Go"
6. Monitor logs: `docker compose logs -f worker`

### Manual Trigger - Command Line
```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py load_gis_data --skip-download
```

## Services Restarted ✅
```bash
docker compose restart beat worker
```

Both services are now running with the updated configuration.

## Next Scheduled Runs

| Task | Next Run | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Building Data Import | 2nd Tuesday of next month, 2:00 AM | Monthly |
| GIS Location Import | January 15, 2026, 3:00 AM | Annually |

## Verification

### Check Current Location Data Coverage
```python
from data.models import PropertyRecord

total = PropertyRecord.objects.count()
with_location = PropertyRecord.objects.filter(
    latitude__isnull=False,
    longitude__isnull=False
).count()

print(f"{with_location}/{total} properties have location data ({with_location/total*100:.1f}%)")
```

### Test Your Property
```python
prop = PropertyRecord.objects.filter(
    street_name__icontains='WALL',
    site_addr_3='77040'
).first()

print(f"Address: {prop.address}")
print(f"Location: ({prop.latitude}, {prop.longitude})")
```

Your property at **16213 Wall St, 77040** now has location data and should work with the similarity search!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `data/tasks.py` - Added `download_and_import_gis_data()` task
2. ✅ `taxprotest/celery.py` - Added annual schedule
3. ✅ `data/admin.py` - Added manual trigger actions
4. ✅ `GIS_IMPORT_SCHEDULE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
5. ✅ `GIS_IMPORT_COMPLETE.md` - This summary file

## Testing

To test the GIS import manually right now:
```bash
# Method 1: Use existing data (fastest)
docker compose exec web python manage.py load_gis_data --skip-download

# Method 2: Re-download and import (slower, ~45 min)
docker compose exec web python manage.py load_gis_data
```

## Monitoring Logs

```bash
# Watch Celery worker (for task execution)
docker compose logs -f worker

# Watch Celery beat (for scheduler)
docker compose logs -f beat

# Check all services
docker compose logs -f
```
