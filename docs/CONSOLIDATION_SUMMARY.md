**Consolidated from:**
- BUILDING_FEATURES_SETUP.md (feature extraction setup)
- FEATURE_EXTRACTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md (improvements)
- FEATURE_IMPROVEMENTS_QUICKREF.md (quick reference)
- SCHEDULED_IMPORTS.md (import schedules)
- IMPORT_STATUS.md (import tracking)
- IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS.md (import procedures)

- Soft delete system
- Scheduled imports (monthly building data)
- Data validation and linking
- Database maintenance
- Troubleshooting imports

---

### 4. GIS.md
**Purpose:** GIS features and location data documentation

**Consolidated from:**
- GIS_SETUP.md (initial setup)
- GIS_IMPLEMENTATION.md (implementation details)
- GIS_IMPORT_COMPLETE.md (completion notes)
- GIS_IMPORT_SCHEDULE.md (update schedules)

**Contents:**
- GIS data sources (HCAD Parcels)
- Setup and dependencies
- Import process and commands
- Location features (coordinates, queries)
- Distance calculations
- Similarity search weighting
- Scheduled updates (annual GIS import)
- Troubleshooting GIS issues

---

### 5. SIMILARITY_SEARCH.md
**Status:** Retained (specific algorithm documentation)

**Reason:** Contains detailed algorithm documentation that doesn't fit cleanly into the other 4 categories. Referenced from README.md.

---

## Archived Files

All original documentation moved to `docs/archive/`:
- BEDROOM_BATHROOM_DATA_ISSUE.md
- BUILDING_FEATURES_SETUP.md
- CELERY_SETUP_COMPLETE.md
- CELERY_TEST_RESULTS.md
- FEATURE_EXTRACTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- FEATURE_IMPROVEMENTS_QUICKREF.md
- GIS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- GIS_IMPORT_COMPLETE.md
- GIS_IMPORT_SCHEDULE.md
- GIS_SETUP.md
- IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS.md
- IMPORT_STATUS.md
- README.dev.md
- README.md.old (backup of original README)
- SCHEDULED_IMPORTS.md
- TABLE_FEATURE_COLUMNS_UPDATE.md
- TABLE_UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md

**Total archived:** 17 files

---

## Benefits

**Before:** 18+ markdown files scattered across root directory
- Difficult to find information
- Duplicate/overlapping content
- Multiple files for same topics
- Status update files that became stale

**After:** 4 comprehensive, organized documents
- Clear purpose for each document
- No duplication
- Easy to navigate
- Logical information hierarchy
- Cross-referenced sections

**Navigation Flow:**
1. **README.md** - Start here for project overview
2. **SETUP.md** - Follow for installation and configuration
3. **DATABASE.md** - Reference for data imports and management
4. **GIS.md** - Reference for location features
5. **SIMILARITY_SEARCH.md** - Deep dive into algorithm (optional)

---

## Cross-References

Each document includes "For more information" sections that link to related documents:

- README.md → SETUP.md, DATABASE.md, GIS.md
- SETUP.md → README.md, DATABASE.md, GIS.md
- DATABASE.md → SETUP.md, GIS.md, README.md
- GIS.md → DATABASE.md, SETUP.md, README.md

---

## Updated References

**Updated files:**
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated to reference new documentation structure

**No longer needed:**
- References to SCHEDULED_IMPORTS.md (now in DATABASE.md)
- References to GIS_SETUP.md (now in GIS.md)
- References to CELERY_SETUP_COMPLETE.md (now in SETUP.md)

---

## Maintenance

**Going forward:**
- Keep README.md user-focused (features, usage)
- Keep SETUP.md technical (installation, deployment)
- Keep DATABASE.md data-focused (imports, ETL, schemas)
- Keep GIS.md location-focused (coordinates, distance, maps)
- Archive status update files after completion
- Update relevant document when adding features
- Avoid creating new documentation files unless absolutely necessary

---

**Result:** Clean, organized, maintainable documentation structure that's easy for developers and AI agents to navigate.
