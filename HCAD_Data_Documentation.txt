=== Definitions & FAQs ===
HCAD Data Definition Help & FAQs

General:
- Data stored in RDBMS, normalized. Requires SQL joins.
- Text files have headers; import using SQL Server (“Import Instructions”).

Real Property Account Numbers:
- Remain static unless split/combined.
- If entire lot sold, account number stays. If split, seller retains original, buyers get new ones.
- No separate PID anymore (GIS replaces it).

Personal Property:
- Mobile homes moved to Real Property (account starts with 600000).
- Freeport value under exemptions.

Land Use Codes:
- land.txt and land_ag.txt store records; 1000 = Res Vacant, 1001 = Res Improved, 2001 = hard-coded override.
- Condos: land valued at 19% of total market value.

Buildings:
- Type (IMPRV_TYPE) and Style (BUILDING_STYLE_CODE).
- Residential (A1–A4) in building_res.txt, others in building_other.txt.
- Areas: Heat Area = living area, Base Area = commercial area, Actual/Gross/Effective Area definitions provided.
- Year built = date_erected, Stories = fixtures file (STY = houses, STC = commercial stories).

Neighborhoods:
- Defined groups of comparable properties by school district; maintained/updated over time.

Economic Areas:
